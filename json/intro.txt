//JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation

//JSON is a text format for storing and transporting data

//If you parse the JSON string with a JavaScript program, you can access the data as an object

//JSON is language independent *

//Since the format is text only, JSON data can easily be sent between computers,
// and used by any programming language.

//JavaScript has a built in function for converting JSON strings into JavaScript objects:
//JSON.parse()

//JavaScript also has a built in function for converting an object into a JSON string
//JSON.stringify()

//You can receive pure text from a server and use it as a JavaScript object.
//You can send a JavaScript object to a server in pure text format.

//JSON makes it possible to store JavaScript objects as text
